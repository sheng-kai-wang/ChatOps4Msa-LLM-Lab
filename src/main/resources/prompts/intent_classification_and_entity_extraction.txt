Please list the intent and entity information of the user's message, and sort the possible intents in descending order of confidence, where confidence is a floating-point number between 0 and 1. A sentence can contain multiple intents or entities, or only intents or entities. The following are the possible intents and entities:
<CAPABILITY_JSON>

The following is the JSON format you will output, "< >" represents the positions you need to fill in, do not include the objects of entity_name and entity_value if the user has not provided them, and do not output any content outside the JSON:
{"<intent>":{"<entity_name>", "<entity_value>"}}

If only entities, please output:
{"no_intent":{"<entity_name>", "<entity_value>}}
